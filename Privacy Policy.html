  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The Custom Tool for Google Sheets does not collect or store any personal data. The Tool only accesses the active Google Sheet and its data for processing and manipulation. No information is shared externally.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>The Tool uses data within your Google Sheet to perform operations like case changes, date filling, data merging, and duplicate highlighting.</p>
  <p>Any data accessed by the Tool is temporary and is not stored outside the Google Sheets environment.</p>

  <h2>3. User Access</h2>
  <p>The Tool is only accessible by users whose email addresses are listed in the <code>allowedUsers</code> array in the script. We do not store or track users' email addresses or other personal information.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>The Tool uses Google's security features to operate within the Google Sheets environment. We do not store or transmit data outside Google Sheets, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>No data is retained after use. Once you close the Google Sheet or the script finishes executing, all data used in the process is discarded. We do not retain any logs of user activity or data processed.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Tool does not integrate with any third-party services that collect or share personal information. All actions are executed solely within the Google Sheets environment.</p>
